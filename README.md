# Predictive Financial Modeling for Software Project Success

 A comparative analysis of traditional estimation methods like **COCOMO** versus modern **machine learning models** to predict the success of software projects.

---

##  Project Overview

This research project evaluates and contrasts:
- Traditional software estimation using the **COCOMO model**
- Machine learning models including:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Naive Bayes

Our objective is to predict **project success/failure** using financial, schedule, and development metrics and to offer a novel hybrid decision framework to resolve conflicts in model predictions.

##  Project Workflow Summary

The notebook processes software project data using the following input features:

- **Actual Budget Spent**  
- **Cost Overrun**  
- **Actual Duration**  
- **Schedule Overrun**  
- **Revenue Generated**  
- **Estimated Duration**  
- **Lines of Code (LOC)**

It then calculates:

- **Profit** = Revenue − Actual Budget  
- **Profitability** = (Profit / Budget) × 100

Two prediction paths are implemented:

1. **COCOMO-Based Estimation**  
   - LOC is used to determine project mode (e.g., Semi-detached for 50 < KLOC ≤ 300)  

2. **Machine Learning Models**  
   - ML models (Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, Naive Bayes) are applied to the same dataset  
   - Predictions, probabilities, and model performance metrics are calculated

 **All results are saved in a separate Excel file named** `project_success_analysis.xlsx` for review and comparison.

##  Key Findings

- The **SVM model** achieved the highest accuracy: **97%**
- All ML models outperformed traditional **COCOMO** (which had only **76% accuracy**)
- Financial indicators (e.g., revenue, cost overrun) were more predictive than technical metrics like lines of code
- A custom **hybrid framework** was proposed to handle conflicts between ML and COCOMO predictions
